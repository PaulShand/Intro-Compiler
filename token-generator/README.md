## Token Generator Overview

This project involves four distinct techniques for generating tokens from given text files, each with its unique approach and complexity:

### Naive Scanner
- **Description**: Iterates through a string one character at a time, using a series of if statements to return the appropriate token.
- **Pros**: Simple and efficient for basic tokenization.
- **Cons**: More complex definitions can be cumbersome to implement.

### Exact Matching Scanner
- **Description**: Utilizes a method of comparing substrings in the text with a predefined list of tokens for exact matches.
- **Pros**: Highly effective for languages with a fixed set of keywords or symbols.
- **Cons**: Less flexible for languages or texts with variable or context-dependent tokens.

### Start of String Scanner
- **Description**: Focuses on the beginning of strings, using pattern matching to identify tokens from the start of each substring.
- **Pros**: Efficient for quickly identifying known token patterns at the beginning of strings.
- **Cons**: May require additional handling for tokens embedded within longer strings or those that don't start at the beginning.

### Named Group Scanner
- **Description**: Employs regular expressions with named groups to identify tokens. Each group in the pattern corresponds to a different token type.
- **Pros**: Offers flexibility and precision, particularly useful in complex texts with varied token types.
- **Cons**: Can be more complex to implement and requires a solid understanding of regular expressions.

Each technique provides a unique approach to tokenization, catering to different needs and complexities in text processing.
